Step 2: Initialize a Local Repository


Open a terminal window.

Navigate to the directory where you want to store your local copy of your repository.



Run the following command:



git init



This will create a new directory called .git in your current directory. This directory will contain all of the Git metadata for your repository.



Step 3: Add Files to Your Repository


Add the files that you want to include in your repository to your local directory.



Run the following command:



git add .



This will add all of the files in your current directory to the staging area.



Step 4: Commit Your Changes


Run the following command:



git commit -m "Add initial files"



This will create a new commit in your local repository. The commit message is a brief description of what you changed in this commit.



Step 5: Push Your Repository to GitHub


Run the following command:



git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repository-name>.git



This will add a new remote repository called origin that points to your GitHub repository.



Run the following command:



git push -u origin main



This will push your local repository to your GitHub repository. The -u origin main flag tells Git to set the origin remote as the default upstream remote and to track the main branch of your remote repository.



You have now successfully created a GitHub repository and pushed your local repository to GitHub. You can now start collaborating with other developers on your project.
